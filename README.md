# DMX-Card
The DMX-Card is a small breakout board that quickly enables the addition of DMX to any microprocessor with +5V TTL UART. The circuit is fully isolated and protected against ESD, and can be easily configured with your choice of output connector.

## Features:
* +5V input
  * Reverse-polarity and over-current protected
* Fault-protected
  * Isolated DC-DC converter (1.5kVDC)
  * Isolated I/O via optocoupler (2.5kVDC)
  * ESD protection on all data inputs and outputs (including DMX)
* Fully DMX compliant
  * ANSI E1.20-2006 RDM compliant
  * 10MBd optocouplers
* Multipe output connector choices:
  * Neutrik NC3FAH (3-pin XLR)
  * Neutrik NC5FAH (5-pin XLR)
  * 0.100" pads (headers, screw terminal blocks, etc.)
